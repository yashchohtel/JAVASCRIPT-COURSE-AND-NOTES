DOM EVENTS :-
==============

DOM (Document Object Model) events in JavaScript are actions or occurrences that happen in the web browser and can be detected and handled by JavaScript. Events are a core part of interactivity in web applications. They allow scripts to respond to user actions, browser actions, or other conditions. Examples include clicking a button, loading a page, submitting a form, or even a timer expiring.
