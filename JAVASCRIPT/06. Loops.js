LOOPS IN JAVASCRIPT :-

Loops in programming are control structures that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition. They are fundamental for automating repetitive tasks and iterating over collections of data.

-------------------------

1. WHILE LOOP :- A while loop in javascript is a control structure that repetedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true. The loop continnues iterating while the condition is true, and it terminates when the condition becomes false.


syntax :-
while(condition){
    code to be executed as long as the condition is true
}

example :-

-------------------------

2. DO WHILE LOOP :- In JavaScript, a do-while loop is a control flow statement that allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. The main difference between a do-while loop and a while loop is that a do-while loop guarantees that the block of code inside the loop will be executed at least once, regardless of whether the condition is initially true or false.

syntax :- 
do(
    code to be executed at least once
) while (condititon);
